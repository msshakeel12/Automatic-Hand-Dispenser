# Automatic-Hand-Dispenser
This is an Arduino based Python project, inspired by the virus spreaded in 2020.
Due to the spead of the virus in 2020, sanitizing hands regularly has become more essential than ever.
Furthermore, contact-less technologies or features are prefered.
The project uses Arduino for the micro-controller, servo-motor to pull the sanitizer actuator and 
light sensor to senses the presence of a hand.
